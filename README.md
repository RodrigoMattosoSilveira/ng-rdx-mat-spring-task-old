# ng-rdx-mat-spring-task

#Introduction
Recently I explored a consulting engagement with a company using the `React` / `Redux` / `Material` / `Spring Boot`; although I've been writing user experience software for a long time, other than a brief `React` assessment in '15, I had no experience with any of these technologies. 

Even though the engagement did not pan out, I decided to learn the `React` / `Redux` / `Material` / `Spring Boot`, found the [React.js and Spring Data REST](https://spring.io/guides/tutorials/react-and-spring-data-rest/) blog, and decided to use it as the basis for me to build a `Todo` application using these technologies. I started with `React` and `Spring`, which is the basis of the blog, then integrated `Redux`, then `Material UI`, and finally I added a `CI/CD` that deploys my [Todo application](https://github.com/RodrigoMattosoSilveira/react-rdx-mat-spring-todo) to [Heroku](https://react-springboot-todo.herokuapp.com//); there are two users: `donald / trump` and `nancy / pelosi`.

Once I completed my `Todo` application I decided to migrate it to `Angular` / `Redux` / `Material` / `Spring Boot`; although the idea seems simple, I learned that integrating `Angular` and `Spring Boot` is more complicated:
* **Project Structure** - The application requires two modules, `frontend` and `backend`, managed by technolgies with different views about file placement;
* **Technology Cooperation** - We use `angular-cli` to manage the `frontend` and `maven` the backend; they rely on `Node.js` and `Tomcat`, respectively, to build and serve the `frontend` and `backend`; their workflows are also different;
* **NGRX** - Although the principles are the same, I learned about `selectors` and `effects`, both available in `React` but which I did not use, which have deep architectural implications;
* **Angular Material** - It is very different than `Material UI`, hence forcing us to rewrite the UI; although this seems hard, it a welcome opportunity to de-couple data accesss and filtering logic from the components;

##Project Structure
I invest a fair amount of time looking for a `natural` way to use `angular-cli` and `spring-initializr` to create the `frontend` and `backend` modules. Eventually I decided to adopt the framework suggested in the [Integrate Angular with a Spring Boot project](https://keepgrowing.in/java/springboot/integrate-angular-with-a-spring-boot-project/):
````text
|- <project root>
   |- backend
   |- frontend
   ...
````
We use `angular-cli` and `spring-initializr`, move files around, and glue them using the wonderful [frontend-maven-plugin](https://github.com/eirslett/frontend-maven-plugin);

##Technology Cooperation
We will address this based on the workflow:
* **Development** - We will work on multiple terminal windows, each handling its own work using the right tools for it; we will rely on `ng` to build and test the `frontend` and `mvn` to build and test the `backend`; we wil rely on `Node,js` to serve the `frontend` and `Tomcat` the backend, and will use `CORS` to mitigate the same-origin issue that would arise from this setup; 
* **Deployment** - We will use the `Maven` `frontend-maven-plugin` to drive the `frontend` build and test, while still relying on `Node.js` to support these task, and use `mvn` to build and test the backend, build the jar;
* **Production** - `Tomcat` will host the `backend` and serve the `frontend`;

##NGRX
* **Selectors** - We will use `selectors` to minimize the amount of state data, constraining ourselves to only raw data, using selectors to compute derived data, and removing these operations from components. An example is a component that renders `tasks` with the functionality to filter them by state; by setting task list and the task state as simple states, we can build a selector that filters `completed` tasks and de-coupling this logic from the component, also making it easier to test it;
* **Effects** - We will use `effects` to execute logic required prior, `REST call` or after event, `WEBSOCKET event`, again decoupling from `actions`, `reducers`, and `components, and, again, simplfying logic and testing;

##Angular Material
My original `Todo` application was a tour de force, quite ugly! We will strive for a more elegant approach.

#Project Structure
We will create the `backend` and `frontend`, grooming them to fit our target structure;
##Project root folder
Create the `project root folder`
````shell script
$ cd ~/projects
$ mkdir ng-rdx-mat-spring-task
````
Notes:
1. I'm a `MAC` user;
1. I keep all my projects on my `home's project folder`;
1. I named my `project root folder` `ng-rdx-mat-spring-task`;
1. Note that I used `tssk` instead of `todo` to overcome my IDE use of `todo` as a reserved word;
